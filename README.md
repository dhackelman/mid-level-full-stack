# mid-level-full-stack
Full stack (mid-level) project. Rough draft. Perl, javascript, AJAX, and more.

##Things that went well:
Lots of jquery functionality to hack together the functionality that I don't have on the back-end
Examples:
1) Search and show the table of appointments
2) "Loading" the appointments without triggering a page refresh
3) Showing and Hiding the new appointment form with animation
4) building the table dynamically
5) beginnings of ajax call to run perl scripts (not yet working);  

##Things I learned to do in Perl and SQLite:
1) My practice.pl file can spin up a localhost server on port 8080
2) if you add "hello?name=..." the screen will display "Hello (name)"
3) I have a basic understanding of  how perl and SQL work together to communicate with dbs via DBI
4) I think that once I fifure out how to send data to the .pl scripts, I can capture that data and use it to update the db and then re-print it
5) My junior Perl project shows that I can write perl scripts to output the db to a file (which I could then snag as a JSON object and then insert into HTML)

##Things I'm working on and need to study:
1) writing better Perl scripts that create that add to a table using the values I send via ajax
2) Finding the "glue" that connects jquery & perl scripts via ajax calls
3) Creating my own backend and learning how to be Full-Stack(ish)
4) Reading more Perl documentation
5) More practice with SQL and MySQL (I stuck to SQLite this time around)

###Thanks for taking time to look through the project. I'd love to get feedback, advice, or more resources to continue learning. Thanks again!
